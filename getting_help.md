# Getting help

We welcome all questions! You can ask them in any of the repository discussions. We prefer questions in GitHub as opposed to email so that others can search them and learn from them.

If you have general questions, please ask in our [top-level discussions](https://github.com/orgs/punch-mission/discussions).

If you're having a problem with a repository, please open an issue in that repository.
