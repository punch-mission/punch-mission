# Welcome to PUNCH

PUNCH, the Polarimeter to UNify the Corona and Heliosphere, is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission to better understand how the mass and energy of the Sunâ€™s corona become the solar wind that fills the solar system.
Four suitcase-sized satellites will work together to produce images of the entire inner solar system around the clock. [Learn more here](https://punch.space.swri.edu/).
